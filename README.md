# Adido - SCSS task

Using a provided design, develop the design using SCSS and any preferred build tool.

## Dependancies

This are mainly dev dependancies and they include;

- Webpack
- Webpack-cli
- Html-webpack-plugin
- Copy-webpack-plugin
- Mini-css-extract-plugin

- sass-loader
- sass
- style-loader

## Instructions

To run the application first clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbuguanewton/adido-scss.git
```

or download the zip file from github.

Then run the following command to install the dependancies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the application we need to build it first using webpack. Run the following command to build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a build directory and copies the files to the build directory.

Now to run the application on the local server,

```bash
npm start
```

The webpack-dev-server will run the application on the local server on port 3000.

> Note: For any further configuration, you can use the webpack.config.js file.
